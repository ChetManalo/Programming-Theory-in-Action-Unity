# Programming Theory in Action (Unity Programmer Milestone Project)

This project demonstrates my understanding of the four pillars of object-oriented programming.
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Project Description
In this project, there are three spheres. All spheres move in a random direction, bumping off of walls and each other. One of the spheres (Blue) has the original class that deals with movement. The other two spheres have special abilities that inherit from the original class.
- Jumping sphere (Green): When space is pressed, the sphere jumps.
- Boost sphere (Red): When space is pressed, the sphere moves faster.
